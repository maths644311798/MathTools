A generalized Young tableau of shape (p1, p2, ..., pm) is an array of p1 + p2 +...+ pm positive integers into m left-justified rows, with pi elements in row i, where
P1 >= p2 >= ... >= pm; the numbers in each row are in nondecreasing order from left to right, and the numbers in each column are in strictly increasing order from top to bottom.
