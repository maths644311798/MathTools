A generalized Young tableau of shape (p<sub>1</sub>, p<sub>2</sub>, ..., p<sub>m</sub>) is an array of p<sub>1</sub> + p<sub>2</sub> +...+ p<sub>m</sub> positive integers into m left-justified rows, with p<sub>i</sub> elements in row i, where p<sub>1</sub> $\geqslant$ p<sub>2</sub> $\geqslant$  ... $\geqslant$  p<sub>m</sub>; the numbers in each row are in nondecreasing order from left to right, and the numbers in each column are in strictly increasing order from top to bottom.

Elliptic Curves are based on NTL library.
